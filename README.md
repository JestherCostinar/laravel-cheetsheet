## 1. Getting Started with Laravel

Before anything else, make sure PHP and Composer are installed on your local workstation before starting your first Laravel project. PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew if you are working on macOS development and in Windows manually installed xampp and composer on browser. Additionally, I advise setting up NPM and Node.

- Xampp Installation link: [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- Composer Installtion link: [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel in different ways.

## Your first laravel project

- You may create you laravel project via composer command:
```
 composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

Alternatively, you can start your Laravel projects by using Composer to globally install the Laravel installer:

- You may create you laravel project via composer command:
```
 composer global require laravel/installer
 
 laravel new example-app
```

Congratulations, you have now create your first laravel project.🥳

Laravel Debugbar is a php package that allows you to quickly debug your application during development. PHP debugbar includes a service provider to register a debugbar in the browser.
